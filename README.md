# Improved Exception Handling in Asynchronous Dart Code

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Dart asynchronous programming: insufficient error handling. The `bug.dart` file shows an example of code that handles some exceptions but not all potential network or data-related errors. The `bugSolution.dart` shows how to enhance it for better robustness and debugging.
